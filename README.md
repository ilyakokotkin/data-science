# Data Science Projects

This repository contains a collection of data science projects focusing on statistical analysis in the medical field. Each project is designed to provide insights into various medical data sets using different statistical tests and methodologies.

## Projects Overview

### Currently

#### 1. Data Normality Assessment (Shapiro–Wilk Test)
- **Description**: A web application that allows users to upload a `.csv` file and assesses the normality of data distribution using the Shapiro–Wilk test. It features a ReactJS frontend and a Python Flask backend.
- **Technologies**: ReactJS, Python, Flask, Pandas, SciPy

### Planned

#### 2. F-Test for Equal Variance
- **Description**: Analyzing datasets to compare the variances between two samples.

#### 3. Two-Sample t-test
- **Description**: A statistical test to compare the means of two independent samples.
- **Technologies**: Python, SciPy

#### 4. Welch Two-Sample t-test
- **Description**: Similar to the Two-Sample t-test but does not assume equal population variance.
- **Technologies**: Python, SciPy

#### 5. Wilcoxon Rank-Sum Test
- **Description**: A non-parametric test to compare two independent samples.
- **Technologies**: Python, SciPy
